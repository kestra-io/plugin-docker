description: "Tasks that build, run, and manage Docker images and containers through the Docker API."
body: "Use these tasks to build and push images, run containers, execute Compose, tag or pull artifacts, stop/remove containers, and prune unused resources directly from Kestra workflows. They require access to a Docker daemon (host socket or remote host) and accept optional config/credentials for private registries alongside task-specific settings such as tags, compose files, and run-time options."
