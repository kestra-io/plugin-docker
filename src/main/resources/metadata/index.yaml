description: "Docker API tasks for building images, running containers, and managing artifacts from Kestra workflows."
body: "Requires access to a Docker daemon via host socket or TCP endpoint; the caller inherits daemon permissions, so scope access carefully. Tasks cover build, push/pull, tagging, Compose execution, container lifecycle, and pruning. Registry auth is optional and set per task; pass tags, compose files, and run options explicitly."
